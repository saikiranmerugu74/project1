Project Title: Basic DevOps Pipeline Setup

Objective: To create a simple DevOps pipeline for a web application to automate building, testing, and deployment.

Steps:
Version Control Setup: Start by setting up a version control system (e.g., Git) if you haven't already. Create a Git repository for your project.

Source Code: Develop a simple web application using a programming language and framework of your choice. 

Build Automation: Set up a build automation tool (e.g., Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to automatically build your application whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository. The build should generate a deployable artifact (e.g., a JAR file or Docker image).

Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your application (if applicable). Integrate these tests into the build process so that they run automatically during the build.

Deployment Automation: Create a deployment script (e.g., using Docker and Docker Compose) that can deploy your application to a local development environment.

Continuous Integration: Configure your build automation tool to trigger builds on every commit to the repository.

Continuous Deployment: Extend your automation to automatically deploy the application to a staging environment (e.g., a cloud server or a virtual machine) whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Monitoring: Implement basic monitoring using a tool like Prometheus or New Relic to track application performance and health.

Deliverables:
A fully functional DevOps pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying your web application.
Documentation detailing the setup and configuration of the pipeline.
A report summarizing the benefits and improvements achieved through automation (e.g., faster deployments, reduced errors).
Skills to be used : Version control (Git), build automation, scripting, unit testing, deployment automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, basic monitoring.
